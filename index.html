        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a third-year at the University of California Riverside, majoring in Business Administration with a concentration on Management. As someone that is compassionate, friendly, sociable, and hardworking, it is my dream to pursue a career in Human Resources. With over 3+ years of leadership experience in fast-paced,teamwork-heavy environments, I believe I am well-fit and equipped for any type of position or circumstance thrown my way. Judging from my intensive list of experience in various fields, I believe I have the tenacity, communication, and out-of-the-box thinking that is needed to thrive in a work environment. Two years ago during my attendance at Cypress College, my board membership experience in the Business Club has taught me how to be consistently creative in curating new designs, innovating new and effective marketing strategies, and solving general issues that are brought up in the club. It was here I learned to be a real team player and develop
strong communication skills that would lead me to become a successful leader in my
current position as President in my campus ministry. Launching "Alabaster" at UC
Riverside has allowed me to showcase my ability to bring my ambitious ideas into
reality, while efficiently managing, coordinating, and motivating an entire crew of board
members. Experience in both these clubs has enabled me to work coherently with
people from across all levels and grow the ability to adapt well to fast-paced
environments.
<br><br>

        Although I am not an engineering major, my internship at ADC Energy Inc. has made
me realize that I want to pursue a career in a corporation that uses technology to
ultimately streamline our quality of life today. At ADC Energy Inc., the company
innovates new technology in electrical energy to effectively increase efficiency in
energy usage while reducing costs at large margins. In other words, ADC Energy Inc.
strives to create an easier, energy-saving world for everyone. It is here I was able to be a first-hand witness to a ground-breaking technological company that can make a difference in the world. I effectively used my time here to work diligently under the management team and soak in as much knowledge and experience to be beneficial to future job opportunities. Because of this experience, I personally grew a heart to work for a company that strives to use its platform, service, and products to make the world a better place in one way or another.
<br><br>

        In conclusion, I would be thrilled to be given an opportunity to pour everything that I
have learned and developed over the years to benefit any company that is willing to champion my skills to benefit their business. With having completed coursework from all aspects of business and having 3+ years of leadership experience under my belt, I believe I would be a solid asset to any team-based environment. If there are any questions regarding my experience and qualifications, I would be more than happy to respond to them in a timely manner. I hope to hear from you soon!
